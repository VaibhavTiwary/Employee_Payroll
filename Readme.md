FullTimeEmployee: Subclass with a fixed monthly salary.
PartTimeEmployee: Subclass with hourly rate and hours worked.
PayrollSystem: Manages a list of employees.

Extending the Project:-
New Employee Types: Easily add new types of employees by extending the Employee class and implementing calculateSalary.
Enhanced Features: Integrate more complex payroll features like bonuses, tax calculations, or integration with databases.
